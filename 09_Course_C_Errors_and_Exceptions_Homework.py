# Problem 1

#Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks.

try:
    for i in ['a','b','c']:
        print(i**2)

except:
    print("An error occured!")

# Problem 2

#Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks.
#Then use a finally block to print 'All Done.'

x = 5
y = 0
try:
    z = x/y

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by Zero!")

finally:
    print("All Done!")

# Problem 3

#Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it.
#Use a while loop with a try, except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.

def ask():
    
    while True:
        try:
            n = int(input("Enter an integer : "))
        except:
            print("An error occurred!")
            continue
        else:
            break
    
    print('Thank you, your number squared is: ',n**2)
